pyshare
=======

This is a file sharing script in python(2.7.5).Actually,there are two scripts,the server_share.py has to be run on the server side first from where file has to be taken and client_share.py on the other host who is accepting the file.In the qualified name of the file field you have to enter the path of the file.This script will soon be updated to it's alpha stage in which both client and server will be incorporated in a single script giving it a actual peer to peer form and some other features also.
